# 2022 Java-Concurrent-Programming Assignment
Airport Simulation (ATC)
----------------------
This part of the assignment will require you to implement the airport simulation. The management of an airport thinks that the way in which the airport is operated means that incoming flights must spend too much time waiting for landing clearance. To evaluate the situation a simulation of the airport has been commissioned. This simulation will simply run with text output describing the events as they occur in the airport and collect a minimal amount of statistical data. You have been tasked to automate the task of Air Traffic Controller (ATC). 

Intention of assignment
-------------
Even if valuable to the owner, the simulation is not the main purpose of this assignment - indeed, if this was the case there are much better techniques for simulating than writing a concurrent program.
The requirement of this assignment is to implement a program in which synchronization and communication takes place between several concurrent processes. It is intended to force you to solve (and not simply avoid) a range of interesting synchronisation problems.
